This is my first post. This is the beginning of something amazing.
I've been wanting to give back to the community for a long time but didn't know how to. Well, this is how I plan to start!
I want to have a place where I put everything I learn, that is accessible everywhere and to everyone. No better place than here.
I also wanted to create something hackable but not fully from scratch, since it would take longer than I'd like. I've looked into Jekyll but, since I'm trying to give Go a go (see what I did there!), I went with Hugo. Well, now I see there is not much Go involved in creating this blog but, nonetheless, I'm one step closer to it!
