Since this is my first time blogging I wanted to take advantage of the features of gitpages (the free feature was the most captivating one!).
I wanted to take advantage of free services like gitpages or firebasee. I tried them both.
Hugo's site has [awesome tutorials](gohugo.com) to get it working on both of them.
With my choice of hugo as a static site generator and with no native way to get it working with git pages, I decided to write this tutorial on my workflow to get new posts in the blog.
I searched around the web for this, so the credits should go to this
