I'm facing a new challenge now: to choose between staying at my well-paid job where I'm not doing what I love but still doing pretty good things, and I have recognition from board members, or to switch to another one where I'll receive considerably less, but the overall work culture is much better, and I'll be doing what I love.
First of all, I know this is the most first-world problem there is, but still, it's the one that I'm facing right now, and it's keeping me from thinking straight in other aspects of my life.
The main issue here is having to provide for my family since I'm the only one working, my wife is still pursuing her degree, and my two daughters both go to day-care, which in Portugal is a large amount of money.
