Since this is my first time blogging I wanted to take advantage of the features of gitpages (the free feature was the most captivating one!).
I wanted to take advantage of free services like gitpages or firebase. I tried them both.
Hugo's site has [awesome tutorials](gohugo.com) to get it working on both of them.
Before going straight to gitpages, I tried hosting it on amen.pt, since they give me free storage when purchasing the domain. But it doesn't include an SSL certificate to get it working with https, so it was a no-go, since I am really trying to get this working for free!
Well gitpages it was and it really works like a charm.
The setup is pretty straight forward. The tricky parts are configuring the DNS and the git submodules (one to deploy the site and another one for the hugo theme).
But, getting past that, it's working really great!
