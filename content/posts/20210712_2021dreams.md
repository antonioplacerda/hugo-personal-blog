A full year is too long to set goals. It's a bettter timespan to set dreams, that will get translated into goals for each quarter, that should get translated into projects and then into concrete small actions. I will try to do that, since I've spent these past quarters dreaming about these goals!

But, for now, here are my dreams for 2021:
- Create a simple DCA trading bot for DeFi;
- Start a "strategy" journal, where I will implement several trading strategies and backtest them;
- Improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge;
- Improve my system design skills;
- Improve my pattern recognition for trading skills;
- Create a simple DApp in the ethereum blockchain;
- Create a bot to automatically claim rewards from farms and swap them;
- Create an explorer sniffer, that will fetch all transactions for the supplied address;
- Create a portfolio app, that will get the records from several exchanges;
- Add the explorer info to the portfolio app;
- Create an arbitrageur bot for CEX;
- Create an arbitrageur bot for DEX;
- Improve my go skills;
