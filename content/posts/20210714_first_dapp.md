It's time to get my Q3 goals going and I've decided to go with the DApp!

I will do this in 4 steps:

1. Create a lottery contract using the remix platform;
2. Create a frontend to interact with the contract, that should be connected to metamask;
3. Deploy the contract to a testnet like Rinkeby;
4. Maybe deploy the app to heroku.


So, the contract should be able to:
- Allow players to enter the lottery with a fixed amount of ether, like 0.001 ether;
- Randomly pick a winner when the contract owner decides to.

I will be updating this post with my progress!

**\[Update]**

YES! I made it, I've deployed the contract to the Rinkeby network! [Here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xEE7F2cD64543fe47BE2cae452510131b829D60fd) it is. What a great success!

I developed the contract using the remix platform and deployed the contract right from there. It was way simpler than what I was expecting.

I should improve and add some tests to the contract, but for now this is enough.

I've also added the solidity code to etherscan, so that I can interact with the contract right there and feel cool!
