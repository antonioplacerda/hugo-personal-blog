It's time to get my Q3 goals going and I've decided to go with the DApp!

I will do this in 4 steps:

1. Create a lottery contract using the remix platform;
2. Create a frontend to interact with the contract, that should be connected to metamask;
3. Deploy the contract to a testnet like Rinkeby;
4. Maybe deploy the app to heroku.


So, the contract should be able to:
- Allow players to enter the lottery with a fixed amount of ether, like 0.001 ether;
- Randomly pick a winner when the contract owner decides to.

I will be updating this post with my progress!
