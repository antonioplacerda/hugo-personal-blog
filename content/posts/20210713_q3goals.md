OK, now it's time to define some priorities. Having dreams is great, but that doesn't get anything done. And also, having them in kind of a blob is also no good!

I know I want to improve my technical skills to feel more comfortable taking on any new challenge that I might face. 
I know I want to learn more about blockchains and smart contracts.
I know I want to improve my trading skills.

So, this quarter I will:
Improve my algorithms and data structures by taking regular exercises and an online course;
Improve my system design skills;
Create a simple DApp and deploy it to the ethereum blockchain or the "binance smart chain" blockchain;
Backtest 3 strategies using either a pinescript, python or by hand;

Well, this seems that it's going to be an amazing quarter!
