I've been working with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) for a while now, and I wanted to have a place to search for the most common functions I use and also some of the not so usual ones.
The best place to store those is an ipython notebook and I've one [here](http://colab.notebook). If you haven't checked out colaboraty, you really should, since it comes with a lot of python libraries pre-installed and allows you to run your notebook in google processors (CPUs or GPUs) or in your local machine.
The keyboard shortcuts differ a bit from the jupyter ones, but it's a matter of hitting the wrong keys a couple of times until you get used to it.

The first thing is to install pandas. You can get it using `pip install pandas`. If you have any trouble with that, you can get a pre compiled version [here](www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).
You'll need to install both `numpy` and `pandas` since `pandas` depends heavily on `numpy`. After you follow the link, search for `numpy`, select your windows version and download it. Then, just `cd` to your downloads folder and run `pip install "name_of_file"` and you should have successfuly installed `numpy`. Now, repeat for `pandas` and you should be good to go.

The usual way `pandas` is imported is importing it as `pd`, like this:
```python
import pandas as pd
```

- Create a dataframe from a dictionary

```python
df_dict = pd.DataFrame([[],[]])
```
